'''
1. What was the single largest carbon producing trip of the year for YELLOW and GREEN trips? (One result for each type)
2. Across the entire year, what on average are the most carbon heavy and carbon light hours of the day for YELLOW and for GREEN trips? (1-24)
3. Across the entire year, what on average are the most carbon heavy and carbon light days of the week for YELLOW and for GREEN trips? (Sun-Sat)
4. Across the entire year, what on average are the most carbon heavy and carbon light weeks of the year for YELLOW and for GREEN trips? (1-52)
5. Across the entire year, what on average are the most carbon heavy and carbon light months of the year for YELLOW and for GREEN trips? (Jan-Dec)
6. Use a plotting library of your choice (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.) to generate a time-series plot or histogram with MONTH
along the X-axis and CO2 totals along the Y-axis. Render two lines/bars/plots of data, one each for YELLOW and GREEN taxi trip CO2 totals.
